GARLIC "training"
------------------

This is the procedure to decide on "reasonable" ranges of various cluster properties, in order for them to be 
selected as electro-magnetic.

- run the GarlicClusterPropertiesProcessor over samples of mono-energetic single electrons and photons, distributed in 
theta and phi: for example energies 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 GeV. You can use more energy points if you wish.
A few thousand events at each point should be OK.
Run the processor over each energy/particle combination individually: this will give a root file for each combination,
which contains histograms of various cluster properties.
template.xml is an example of a Marlin steering file for this part.

- the decideCuts.C macro reads these root files, finds the 1, 5, 95, 99% points for each cluster observable 
for each cluster energy, and then parameterizes these as polynomial functions of log10(cluster energy).
It writes an output text file garlicCuts.txt which can be used as input to the main GarlicProcessor.
This file can be edited by hand to remove unwanted cuts (e.g. lower cut on the pointing angle, upper cut
on the fraction of layers containing hits, which don't really make sense).
It also produces a .ps file which show the parameterisations in graphical form.
